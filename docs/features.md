# Hans Features & Plugins Reference

Hans offers a wide range of commands and plugins, all built with `SlashCommandBuilder` for seamless Discord integration.

---

## ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Hans can understand and process natural language messages, not just slash commands! This means you can mention Hans and type requests in plain English, and Hans will map your message to the correct command automatically.

**How it works:**

- Mention Hans in a message (e.g., `@hans what's the weather in Tokyo?`).
- Hans uses its NLP engine to classify your intent and extract parameters (like city names, Twitch usernames, or message counts).
- If the intent is recognized with high confidence, Hans runs the appropriate command with the extracted parameters.
- If the intent is unclear or confidence is low, Hans will fall back to ChatGPT to answer your question.

**Supported NLP Commands:**

- `weather` â€” Ask about the weather in any city ("What's the weather in Madrid?").
- `twitch` â€” Get Twitch streamer info ("Show me ninja's Twitch profile").
- `moderation` â€” Purge/delete messages ("Delete 5 messages" or "Remove 10 messages from John").
- `ask` â€” General questions or topics ("Explain quantum physics").

> Hans will always try to extract the right parameters (like city, username, or number of messages) from your message, even if you phrase it differently.
